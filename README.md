# OC React POC 2

This explores using a lightweight React-like vdom implementation (Preact - https://preactjs.com/)
to power the internals of a component, without requiring the rest of the
framework or individual apps to use or even know about Preact.

**NOTE**: this requires the `mg-preact-poc` branch in ividev.
